OpenGL and Shading Assignments       {#readme}
==============================

The following assignments will be graded.
Please read carefully the instructions.

There are two executables this time. A demo for you to view and, if you like play with, as well as the [Assignment](@ref assignment-phong).

The assignment is due on the 10th of October.

When you have completed the assignment, run your program and press "A".
A PPM image will be written with the name **solution.ppm**.

You should upload to Brightspace the same folder you downloaded with the modified files.
Do not forget to check if your **solution.ppm** is included in the zipfile, it will be used for grading!
